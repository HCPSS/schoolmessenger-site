## New Features

This process is ideal for replacing a PDF newsletter, and sprucing up your current email-only newsletter.

Web Services has positioned HCPSS websites and our mobile application to syndicate news with ease. 

This means that you can position your news to post on your school's website, push to the HCPSS iphone/android app, and link up with your newsletter. All of this begins by posting news on your school website.

## What Works

Public Information uses a process that allows us to post news stories all week, and then pick stories to send out every Wednesday via our Weekly Newsletter.

A news item gets posted individually, and is given it's own URL to share:

This URL is then used to link readers to the full content from a smaller blurb in our weekly news:

Linking users to the article allows the Public Information Office to get news items out in a timely manner, but not have to put all of the news content into one email.

## The Process

Schools have the ability to use the same process between school websites, SchoolMessenger, and the HCPSS App. Mimicing the Public Information Office's process can help schools reach more of their audience and reduce the amount of time spent on newsletters.

### The Website

Collaborate with web managers to post news items as they come in. All news items are pushed to the HCPSS Mobile App when they are published. Web Managers should be pretty familiar with this process, and can send newsletter editors a link once a news item is posted. 

If web managers need a refresher, [check out our documentation](http://hcpss.github.io/schoolsites-help/news/2014/07/15/news-messages/) on news items.

### The Weekly Newsletter

Once a link is established on your site and it's already been pushed out via the app, you can add it as a link in your weekly newsletter. 

- Open up the news item on your site

- Copy the link (e.g. "http://rbes.hcpss.org/messages/panther-holiday")

Type up a one sentence blurb to give parents some context about the article, and follow it up with a "read more" or "find out more" link to the full article. 

This enables parents to pick a choose how deep they want to go on the content, and keeps the newsletter trim now that the content is hosted on the school's website. If needed, [view the documentation](/editing-content/) on adding links.

## Result

From posting content on the website, content is pushed to the app and able to be pasted onto the newsletter. Another route is social media, whether that's facebook or twitter. As long as there's a link, there's a way.
