## Email Subscriptions

Parents who are not receiving email messages can have a variety of different things going on affecting their subscription.

### Spam

Messages still have the chance of going to spam. If parents check their spam and see that there's some messages from their child's school in there, have them mark the message as "not spam". Most email clients will have this option inside of the message.

<blockquote>You can also view our documentation on email reports to see if they're in the recipient list</blockquote>

### Portal Access

If you’re checking their information and it all reads correctly, often times the “has portal access” box isn’t checked off. 

### Email Field Data

Another common issue is that they do not have an email listed in the primary field. They should always have their primary email listed first because that’s the email that will get general messages.

## Data Sync

Remember that the data doesn’t sync up until the next day at 5am, so they won’t get any messages until the day after you change their information.

## Text Messages

After SchoolMessenger's initial launch there was a message sent to parent subscribers for opting-in to recieve text messages. Parents had to respond to the number 68453 with the word "YES" to opt-in. 

If they never recieved this message or changed their cellphone number and would now like to opt-in, they can text the word "YES" to the number 68453 from the number that's in Aspen. 

### Message Failure?

Sometimes a message will fire back that it was undeliverable or failed. This often times means that SMS shortcode messages are blocked from their number. 

Just have the parent contact their cellphone carrier (calling their retail store works) to have SMS shortcodes unblocked. The next day, they can try sending the message again.
