## After the Broadcast

Immediately after you send out a broadcast, you can check the message report. On the dashboard underneath "broadcasts" there will be reports for the most recently sent messages. 

Hover over the wrench and screwdriver, then click on "report". 

It should bring up a broadcast summary page. There's a "related links" section with links to a copy of the PDF that was sent to you, time distribution, and recipients not contacted list. 

### Parents Not Contacted

The "recipients not contacted" listing.

This shows you anyone who had the message blocked, didn't provide an email, or was a duplicate email. Duplicates are removed by default, and are basically for parents who have more than one child at your school. 

To search for a parent on this list, use your browser's "find" feature. On a Mac, this is command+F, and on PC it is control+F. Then, search for the last name or email of the parent. You will have to cycle over to the next page if needed to search the whole list. 

You always can hit back in the application to return to the previous prompt. 

### Other Metrics

The report feature will also give you a summary on the total number of recipients that were contacted, and the number of emails. 

This is shown underneath the summary area. Remember that the recipient number will usually be lower than the number of emails because that data is based off the amount of students at your school.

Beneath the summary under totals, there's also numbers on the amount of duplicates removed and parents who didn't have an email listed. 

### Checking all emails

Underneath totals, you can click on "email:" to view all recipients who were contacted. This is useful to check if a parent has been able to read or skim a message. You can search using your browsers find feature and cycle through lists by using the page feature.
