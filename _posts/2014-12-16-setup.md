## Overview

The SchoolMessenger system is seamlessly integrated with the Aspen Student Information system. Contacts for parents are pulled directly from Aspen, and each year the information is automatically updated according to enrollment. 

Parents no longer have to update their student’s grade or sign up for their subscription. The only time a parent ever needs to change their subscription data is if they get a new phone number or email. 

When you send out a general message to your default school list it goes to the primary emails listed for the first two parent/guardian contacts. 

When you send out an emergency message it goes to both emails listed for both contacts. You can also send SMS (text) messages when there’s an emergency situation.
